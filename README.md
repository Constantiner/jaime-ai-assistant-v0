# 🏆 Jaime AI Assistant: My Vibe Coding Contest Journey

## 🚀 The Challenge

4 hours. One AI chat bot. Figma designs + specs. Just me vs. WindSurf.

*Check out my contest submission here: [Contest Result Tag](https://github.com/Constantiner/jaime-ai-assistant-v0/releases/tag/Contest-result)*

## 💻 Tech Stack

- [V0](https://v0.dev/) for generating the Next.js project matching design requirements
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) for implementing the chat functionality
- **GitHub & Vercel:** Set up automatic deployments to share both code and the live application

## 🔍 Key Insights

### V0: The Design Champion 🎨

- **Simply amazing!** Understands and translates layout images into functioning code with remarkable accuracy
- **Highly flexible:** Can modify entire layouts or target specific components without breaking the design harmony
- **Asset-friendly:** Seamlessly incorporates custom design assets like icons, maintaining design consistency
- **Wish list:** Direct Figma file import capability & contextual file attachments when modifying specific UI elements

### Time Management Matters ⏱️

- Modern AI tools offer incredible power but require patience—expect periods of waiting while they process complex requests
- **Lesson learned:** Allocate time strategically—a 50:50 split between design perfection and implementation gives breathing room for unexpected challenges
- Don't underestimate the learning curve with unfamiliar tools—plan buffer time for adaptation and troubleshooting

### Tool Selection Is Critical 🛠️

- **Skip the hype:** Trendy tools aren't always the most effective—evaluate based on your workflow needs, not just popularity
- **WindSurf challenges:** Faced frustrating cycles of thinking-error-retry loops and struggled with basic component extraction tasks
- **Copilot contrast:** GitHub Copilot delivered immediate, reliable results with the same prompts that WindSurf struggled with
